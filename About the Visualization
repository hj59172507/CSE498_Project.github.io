The charts designed to provide an interactive way for viwer to process vehicle collisions reported by state police of Maryland in 2012, 
specifcally, it is designed to answer general question like how accident is distributed over time and injury ratio. <br/>

1. Hybrid structure : Interactive Slide Show, where user can go forward and backward like a slideshow. <br/>
It is also interactive as each graph provide tooltip for user to interactive with.<br/>

2. There are three scene in this visualization, each more detail than previous one. I follow a consistance annotation, and color theme. <br/>
First scenes is line graph, I pick them because both axes are quantitative and line graph are best because its hevay hint of position. <br/>
The second graph I wish to enhance the contrast between accident with injury and without, hence I used a side-by-side bar graph.<br/>
I also purposely choose blue and orange for the bar to highlight the difference as they are opposite on color wheel.<br/>
Legend is also included in top left corner. <br/>
Last scenes is also a line graph, same as first one that line graph provides a simple yet effective mean convey information by showing visually appealing highs and lows.<br/>
Prev button and Next Button will automatically turn grey to hint to user that they have reach the first or the last page respectively.<br/>

3. There are annotations in all slides, which serve to point out important fact about the graph.<br/>
In each scene, annotations are there to guide user to see important data as well as provide possible explaination.<br/>

4. The first parameter is the currentScene variable which keep the state viwer currently in.
Another parameter is user mouse location, which will be use to display detail data on demand.<br/>

5. In this visualization, trigger are start off by user interaction. When user hover over data in each scene, triggers will 
go off to retrieve and show detail data base on position of mouse. The user will be hint that trigger is available because I put a circle
around each data point to draw user attention as well as increase area of trigger.<br/>
In addition, when user click on buttons to move forward or backward in slideshow, another trigger will transition to other scene 
base on the current scene parameter.<br/>
